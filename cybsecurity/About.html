        <p>Hello!!! This is Pawan Verma. I'm have created this website.I like to watch every one working analyse them. I learn for each everyone so, that keep updating myself in the field of technology also like know about technology in market.
Apart from that i really love training because it gives me opportunity to be creative to be different every time. It's not like day to day every training is new experience. I love to interacting people listen to everyone point of view and try to learn good things from that.
At last I'm very much inspired from Elon musk. He is innovative, creative, energetic, enthusiastic personality. They always try to do something new this will make me interest on the field of technology.</p>
        <p>Enthusiastic computer science student. Always looking for learning new technologies whenever possible. Hunger for knowledge drives me to learn anything.

Three words, Bibliophile, Elocutionist, and a quintessential Geek. I am the kind of guy who prefers Super Computers over Super Cars.

I am that type of guy who believes in imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not and therefore the foundation of all invention and innovation
Mostly, I am caught up writing code and procedures or assisting subordinates with their daily challenges .when I am not doing that, I am either busy with the indoor games, my books or my friends.

there are two things I am always up for coffee and a conversation.</p>
